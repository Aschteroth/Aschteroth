Hi, I’m Julian, a German Industrial Engineer working as Business Analyst in an e-commerce logistics startup. 

I’m interested in everything related to data science, finance and fine cuisine.  
Currently learning about operationalizing ML with Udacitys "Machine learning Engineer with MIcrosoft Azure" Nanodegree, managing Postgres Databases and writing short Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks in my day-to-day work.
